Hey there, I'm Ronja and I make shader tutorials with the goal to make shaders understandable by everyone. 
The focus of this tutorials is on unity shaders with hlsl. They are more accessible than direct implementations of the shader APIs yet flexible and powerful.

I try to make a new tutorial every two weeks so the list of tutorials is growing quickly. If you have any wishes for shaders you want to know how they work write me a message and I'll see what I can do.

If you're completely new to shaders I recommend your start with the series about the absolute basics, explaining how to make a very simple shader from nothing, you can find it [here](/basics.html). I still recommend you to start with a different programming language if you're completely new to programming because the paralell nature and lacking debugging tools can make shaders more unintuitive than other languages.

You can also find me on twitter at [@totallyRonja](https://www.twitter.com/totallyRonja). If you like what I do and want to support me you can do that on Patreon (<https://patreon.com/{{ site.patreon.username }}>) or Ko-Fi (<https://ko-fi.com/{{ site.ko-fi.username }}>).
